# Learning outcomes
Learn how to build a simple but engaging game and practice the Python basics.

## About
Invite a friend to play the Last Pencil, a game where you decide who wins. In this project, your opponent is a computer that is an expert in the game. But it's up to you to choose who wins.

## Example
```
How many pencils would you like to use:
> 10
Who will be the first (User, Bot):
> User
||||||||||
User's turn:
1
|||||||||
Bot's turn!
> 2
|||||||
User's turn:
2
|||||
Bot's turn!
> 1
||||
User's turn:
3
|
Bot's turn!
> 1
User won!
```

## Additional goals
Bot follows a winning strategy, so he's not just picking a random number of pencils, he's actually trying to win.
